Meteor Redux Demo
=================

This repository contains a demonstration application for the article [A bridge
between React and
Meteor](https://subvisual.co/blog/posts/79-working-with-meteor-react-and-redux).
In this application you can write, remove, and see messages. If you try to write an empty
message you'll see an error. While the messages are loading you see a
"loading" message.

The purpose of this application is to demonstrate a possible setup for Redux on
Meteor, most code written here is not acceptable on production application.

This application uses the package
[meteor-ditto](https://github.com/gabrielpoca/meteor-ditto). It's a working in
progress implementing the system I talk about in the blog post.
